  "The objective of the game is to hit as many colors as possible within a 30-second timeframe. The game starts with a random color appearing, followed by three answer options in hexadecimal format. Two of the options are randomly generated incorrect answers, while one is the correct answer. With each round, a new color appears and the player has 10 seconds to select the correct answer and earn points, or lose points if they fail to respond in time or choose the wrong answer. If the player fails to respond in time, they are given a penalty of 2 negative points. If they respond incorrectly, they receive a penalty of 1 negative point. If they respond correctly within the allotted time, they are rewarded with 5 positive points.";
